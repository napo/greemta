The municipality of Madrid offers a lot of data to start from and, by visiting the [open data portal](https://datos.madrid.es/portal/site/egob/), you can find lots of datasets.

Our focus is, in particular, on green and therefore we ask you to include at least one of these datasets:
* [trees](trees)
* [green areas](green areas)

## Important note:
the data is released under a CC-BY license.<br/>
In some cases the dataset doesn't yet cover the entire territory of Madrid, but it is more than enough for our purposes.

Thank you!
